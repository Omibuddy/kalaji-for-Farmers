# About us
It Started with a plan 'Properly store fruits and vegetables for maximum freshness; they'll taste better and last longer, helping you to eat more of them before they go bad'. It will cost a lot and need space. If you have the discipline to focus on the early adopters, the majority will come along eventually. There we present "kalaji" a pre-booking platform for vegetables and fruits.
Freshness: as they go through fewer intermediaries, the time required for storage ortransport does not compromise the freshness of the fruits and vegetables.

Being seasonal products have health benefits, since they provide the nutrients that the body needs depending on the region and season of the year in which they are consumed.

Since local fruits and vegetables don’t face adverse situations in transportation and time they avoid using chemicals on their products

Local fruits and vegetables are produced in a close ratio (approximately 100 kilometers maximum), which evidently is a relatively short distance between the producer and the final consumer.

Vegetables and fruits are an important part of a healthy diet, and variety is as important as quantity.

 No single fruit or vegetable provides all of the nutrients you need to be healthy. Eat plenty every day.

A meta-analysis of cohort studies following 469,551 participants found that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, with an average reduction in risk of 4% for each additional serving per day of fruit and vegetables.
