# kalaji-for-Farmers
Kalaji is a marathi Word for 'taking care'. in this project i have created a pre-booking web site for retail shops and brokers of vegetable and fruits, where a farmer upload states of vegetable like with in 10 days farmers is going to take vegetable to sell. On that basic the broker can book the vegetable how much required.
